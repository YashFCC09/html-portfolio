<u><h1>About Me</h1></u>

<b><p>My academic journey began at P Jog English Medium Pre Primary School, where I laid a solid educational foundation that propelled me to achieve 78% in my 10th-grade exams under the Maharashtra State Board. During my 9th standard, I excelled in the Computer Competition Exam, earning a notable B+. Continuing my education at St Ann's Jr College, I successfully completed my 12th-grade exams with a respectable 55% from the same board. This academic trajectory paved the way for my admission to the esteemed International Institute of Information Technology in Hinjewadi, Pune, where I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering (BE CSE).</p></b>

<b><p>My interest in coding and technology blossomed during my initial semesters at the institute. In my first semester, I undertook a project on Room Temperature Sensing, leveraging my theoretical knowledge to develop a practical solution that received accolades from faculty and peers alike. Building on this success, I embarked on a more intricate endeavor in my second semester with the creation of a Smart Plant Monitoring System. This project not only honed my programming skills but also deepened my understanding of IoT (Internet of Things) applications in sustainable agriculture.</p></b>

<b><p>Beyond academics, I actively pursue diverse interests that complement my technical studies. I am an avid enthusiast of physical fitness, finding balance through regular exercise and sports activities. My passion for exploring cutting-edge technologies extends to automotive engineering, where I engage in projects that integrate software with mechanical systems. This multifaceted approach to learning fuels my curiosity and drives me to continually expand my knowledge base.</p></b>

<b><p>I am driven by an insatiable curiosity to master new coding languages and technologies, reflecting my commitment to continuous personal and professional growth in the dynamic field of computer science. My ultimate aspiration is to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry, leveraging innovation and creativity to solve real-world challenges.</p></b>
